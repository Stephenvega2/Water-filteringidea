Solar Water Filtration Simulation
---------------------------------
This project simulates a solar-powered water purification system using Python and the Kivy framework.
It models how water clarity improves over time when filtered with materials like charcoal, gravel, and magnets.

How It Works:
- The simulator represents a solar distillation system that uses heat, filtration, and magnetic separation to clean water.
- Simulated effectiveness is based on the physical properties of the materials (porosity, adsorption, etc).
- Water clarity starts as "dirty" (0.0) and increases step by step, up to "clear" (1.0), based on modeled evaporation, condensation, and magnetic filtering.
- The process runs automatically; “Clarity” is shown live as the simulation progresses.

Features:
- Filtration Materials Table: Lists real-world properties of charcoal, gravel, and magnets.
- Live Water Clarity: The current state of the simulated water is displayed and updates in real time.
- Automatic Simulation: The process starts and runs by itself until the water is “clear”.

Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Kivy
- pandas
- numpy

Installation:
    pip install kivy pandas numpy

Running the Simulation:
    python Solarfilter.py

Output:
- The interface shows water clarity and progress of purification.
- Once clarity reaches 1.0, the water is considered clear and the simulation ends.

Note:
- The simulation uses general scientific properties of filter materials.
- It is a conceptual and educational tool, not based on real-world water sample data.

Why This Matters:
Clean water is essential for life! This simulation can help students, engineers, and innovators understand and improve solar water filtration designs, making safe water more accessible for everyone.
